1. Quadratic Equations:

The general form of a quadratic equation:
ax^2 + bx + c = 0

Solution using the quadratic formula:
x = [-b Â± sqrt(b^2 - 4ac)] / 2a

Example:
Given the equation 2x^2 - 3x - 5 = 0,
Find the value of x.

2. Polynomial Functions:

General form of a polynomial of degree n:
P(x) = an*x^n + an-1*x^(n-1) + ... + a2*x^2 + a1*x + a0

For n = 2, it becomes a quadratic equation.

3. Linear Equations:

The general form:
y = mx + b

Where m is the slope and b is the y-intercept.

Example:
For the equation y = 2x + 1,
The slope, m = 2 and y-intercept, b = 1.
